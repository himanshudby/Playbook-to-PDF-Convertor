## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and set your Gemini API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   **Note:** The variable must be prefixed with `VITE_` for Vite to expose it to the client.
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
